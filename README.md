# Overview

A C++11 library and software to efficiently summarize genetic polymorphism statistics from [binary variant files](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed). Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci and relationships among individuals are estimated using Locality-Sensitive Hashing ([LSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing)).
